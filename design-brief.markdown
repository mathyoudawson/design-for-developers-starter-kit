# [Cheatsheets] Design Brief

## A brief summary of the business / site goals.
Cheatsheets provides a platform for people to explore, create and modify
cheat sheets. A cheat sheet is a list of terms with descriptions to be used as
reference when learning a new tool/language/framework. Users need to be able to
quickly reference exisiting cheat sheets and modify others to customize their
learning experience.

## The key users.
Users can explore and find existing cheat sheets created by other users. They
can clone existing cheat sheets and modify them to suit their needs. They can
also create new cheat sheets from scratch. There is an expectation that the site
is easy to navigate and quickly reference a specific term at a moments notice.

## Scenarios in which your app or site will be used.
A user is learning a new programming language, Ruby. They have learnt an
enormous amount of syntax and terms and are worried about forgetting it. In
order to preserve their knowledge and have a living document to reference, they
visit Cheatsheets. Cheatsheets provides them with exisitng Ruby Cheatsheets'
which they draw inspiration from. They decide to start a fresh Cheatsheet and
slowly add more 'cheats' as they learn more.

Another user is experienced using Vim but can often forget some of the more
complicated commands. They find an existing Cheatsheet to reference and become
more skilled using Vim.

## Design style guidelines to follow.
* Easy to look at for extended periods of time
* Balanced
* Embrace the grid
